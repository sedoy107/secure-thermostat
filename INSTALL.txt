This guide provides the directions on how to properly install the secure themostat on your Raspberry Pi.
This guide only provisions the software part of the installation process. The hardware part will come as a dedicated word document.

0. Have a Raspberry Pi ready and run the following in order to install the requred software:
sudo apt-get install git, python-pip, python-paramiko
sudo apt-get install  mysql-server-5.5
While installing mysql you might have numbers different from 5.5 as the virsion might have becom updated.
You will also be prompted to create a password for your database. If you're planning on running http server on this raspberry, then I would make this one very strong.
Note that you might have some of these packages installed.

1. Download the pre-requsites: 
	a. If for some reason you haven't installed paramiko on the step 0, download it from github:
	git clone https://github.com/paramiko/paramiko
		x. Proceed into the paramiko folder and run:
		python setup.py build
		sudo python setup.py install
			Note there may be issues caused by missing pre-requisites for paramiko library.
			I cannot recall any issues as I installed it long time ago. Please let me know if 
			the installation of paramiko library doesn't go smoothly.
	b. Download another package, PyMouse: 
	git clone https://github.com/pepijndevos/PyMouse
		x. Proceed into the PyMouse folder and run:
		python setup.py build
		sudo python setup.py install
			Same thing here, there may be issues caused by missing pre-requisites for paramiko library.
			I cannot recall any issues as I installed it long time ago. Please let me know if 
			the installation of paramiko library doesn't go smoothly.
	c. Install image processing library, PILLOW:
	sudo pip install PILLOW
	d. Optionally, if you are planning to use MODBUS devices, PyModbus must be installed:
	sudo pip install pymodbus

2. Create two unix users on your Raspberry Pi. One will be hvac, the other - sensor:
sudo useradd sensor -m
sudo useradd hvac -m
passwd sensor
password hvac
Note, you will need the passwords for hvac and sensor users very soon, please do not forget them.

3. Clone the contents of secure thermostat onto your Raspberry Pi, for example into /home/pi/:
git clone https://github.com/sedoy107/secure-thermostat.git

4. Now create a ssh session for hvac user:
ssh hvac@localhost
Right now you're logged in as hvac and by default you're in the home folder which is /home/hvac

5. Copy hvac's files:
cp -r /home/pi/secure_thermostat/hvac .

6. Generate private/public key pair (for simplicyty all prompts just hit enter):
ssh-keygen

7. Leave the hvac's session:
exit

8 - 11. Same as 4 - 7 but replace hvac with sensor.

12. You should now be back to your original home directory for pi user. Type the following and hit enter to make sure we're at the correct location:
cd

13. Now you have cloned the project to your Raspberry Pi and should see secure_thermostat folder. Enter the folder:
cd secure_thermostat

14. Export mysql database. It is easier to do with phpmyadmin, but if you are freaking out installing a web serer and the stuff that comes along with it on your thermostat host then do it via command line:
	a. mysql -u db_username -p
		x. mysql> CREATE DATABASE thermostat;
	c. mysql -u db_username -p thermostat < thermostat.sql.

15. Open config.py in the text editor of your choice and carefully read through it and make changes in accordance with your setup. Instructions are inside.
Note that you can also modify pictures that are located at the /seests/pics
You can choose background picture that you like by placing it in the aforementioned folder and modifying the config.py, BACKGROUND_PICTURE_NAME variable
	
16. At this point, if everything went through the way it was expected, you should be able to run daemon.py, hvac_daemon.py, and tgui.py. These are the executive components:
sudo python hvac_daemon.py
python daemon.py
python tgui.py
Note that on newer versions of raspbian sudo prefix for the hvac_daemon.oy file is not necessery as it does not require root access to manipulate GPIO.

17. Place script ThermostatAutoLaunch.py to your desktop:
cp ThermostatAutoLaunch.py ~/Destop
Now you have a script on your desktop that will run all the components in one piece.

If something is still not working, please leave comments or send me an e-mail with the error, and I will help to resolve the issue.
